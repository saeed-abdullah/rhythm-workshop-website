            <p> We are constantly changing. Every week. Every day. Every minute. Our bodies coordinate
      many physiological and mental changes to help us adapt to our environment. As a 
      consequence of physiological fluctuations, we can be more suited to certain types 
      of work at specific times of the day. Disruptions of our rhythms can have serious
      impacts on our sleep, productivity, and well-being. In particular, changes in daily
      routines can have severe consequences for someone with a serious mental illness, like
      bipolar disorder. In spite of these natural fluctuations, the technologies we use
      to work and to communicate tend to respond identically throughout the day. However,
      a new class of technologies has emerged that takes our rhythms into account. </p>

            <p> This interactive workshop will bring together researchers interested in designing
      technologies to support biological rhythms. We invite participants from a range of
      disciplines (including sleep, well-being, and mental health) to take part in this
      workshop to discuss the design and development of technology to support individual
      rhythms; social impacts of measuring these physiological, behavioral, and mental
      changes; and feedback interventions to help people become more aware of these changes. </p>

            <p> Submit a 2-4 page paper in the ACM Extended Abstract format about your ongoing 
      work, recent results, or study methods related to biological rhythms. At least one
      author of each accepted papers must attend the workshop and all participants much
      register for the workshop and attend at least one day of the conference.
